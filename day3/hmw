# 1 finding kmer matches
	right no, we're keeping count. now we need to keep positions.
		create a list (two passes, first pass - go through target and populate diction where keys are kmers and words are positions)
		see if query has a match in your target dictionary
		if you find a match, you keep track position of target (and w're know position in query bec we're enumerating it)
	how to keep track of position
	return the position , whre match occurs
	target : .fa
	query: link

#### START

import sys, 

# define dictionary; will match 
kmer_matches={}


### Remember
- target_sequence_name = ID from FASTAReader
- target_start = sequence[0]
- query_start = 
- k-mer

Calculate all k-mers. Take first k-mer and align it with all places in target

# 2 BLAST ungap extension

# 1 FIND SEED-LIKE SEQUNCES USING INDEX

query:droYak.fa
target: subset.fa

use new fasta

implement a script that finds matching kmers between a single query and a database of targets
