#statsmodels, linear regression, ols function least squares
# 4 files that contain signals from his mod
# bigwig
# does the level of histone mod predict gene expression
# my gtf files - find TSS. 
    integral around it
    
# 500 bp expand, give you a region.
# to do this, use cmd bedavg or bigwigAverageOverBed
# gives you avg signal fro histone mod

#then combine this with FPKMs
# for each transcript, have avg histone mod and corresponding FPKM
# then, do da regression thing. statsmodels, formula Ols??
### chipseq data from a db -- embryo

### 4 histone modifications. make program take one bedfile and last stage "893"
