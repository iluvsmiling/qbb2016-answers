have a component that is learnable

a few variables that computer learns, given the data input (training data)

SUPERVISED LEARNING
- X, input var or vector
- Y , output, some vector of outputs
- Goal: learn this function f. that will mapp values of x to y. And have it be a true, good predition of true y

Learn relationship through learnng data

**How is this different from modeling , fitting data

- Regression: response (y) is continuous 
- Classification: response is categorical. given x, tell me which class x belongs to. here is a sequence...is it a promoter, intronic, etc

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

- X, input variable or vector, observations
- We are very good at collecting data, but getting labeled data...we can sequence a lot of things but harder to tell you what it is

-Two problems:
	A) dimension reduction - find reduced dim that will tell you info about x....i.e. visualization. 
	20,000 genes. => put this in 2d or 3d space. PCA
	Flow cytometry - looking at 35 parameters/markers at once. 	

	
	B) clustering - try to identify groups within X that are similar to other, whos expression profiles are similar.
	

:LINEAR REGRESSION:	

- find correlation coefficient for a given X data input and then predict y

f(x) = B_0 + sum(Bj* X_j) over p, j = 1
The learning problem: find coefficients.

find a plane that minimizes dimensions?
	** bias? it loses information. 
	bias variance trade-off : overtraining can be a problem. 


***The learning problem is to find coefficients to predict Y. but what does that have to do with dimension reduction (i.e. finding the plane that condenses all your datapoints).**

	dimension reduction can be done just to understand your data, not necessarily to find y

 PCA: unsupervised dimension reduction

- smallest and largest PC. 

Screeplot
- Evalues vs num of dimensions

Microarray paper:
	sorted 
	PCA 
most successful ML: supervector machine,
	the idea of projecting your data into an even higher dim space
	kernel methd, data is non-linearly transformed
		if you find a linear separator in that higher dim space, you can use that

programming:
certain modules are slow to load like matplotlib

py.lin is a nice module that detects errors


QUESTIONS:

******Is there a stat class to understand fMRI or genomics-- design algorihms?
