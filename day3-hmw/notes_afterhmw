Three STrategies:
1. hash all target sequences
	scan over query
2. hash each target then scan query

3. hash query
4 hash both 

Problem 1:

- implement a script that finds matching kmers between query and target
- input: 
	target.fa =  
	query. fa
	k
- output
	target seq name = line[0] after carrot
	target start = position of 
	query start
	kmer seq

strategy
- define kmer




Problem 2:

hit at 390, 391. 
extend by 2 bps


Data = open(sys.argv[1])
query = sys.argv[2]


for line

haversat
gungne
	hashed query
	look up 
	look forward
		loop , looking forward until you get a mismatch
		then you stop
		* if you just consider the first match, you dont need to go back
		* 

1 kmer_counter to kmer_matcher

usage: kmer.py target.fa query.fa k
output: target_ID target_start query_start k
	1000 lines, k = 11


import sys, fasta_fixed

query_fa = open (sys.argv[1])
targeta = open(sys.argv[2])
k = int(sys.argv[3])

kmer_query = {}
target_gene = {}
